# DoggyDay Admin

This is an admin UI to manage DoggyDay matches and to generate the match emails
and send them to the users.

## Development

To develop the application with automatic reload, you can use the commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

After that you can open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser, and all the
changes to the code should reload the page automatically.

## Building

To build the UI you need to have Node.js and `npm` installed. The build command
should be run in the top level directory and is simply:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

This should generate three files in the `dist` directory:

```
index.html
main.js
main.js.LICENSE.txt
```

Simply opening the `index.html` file in your browser should work.
